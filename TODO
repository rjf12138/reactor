1. 在速度测试时，客户端会崩溃
Thread 11:

==18388==  If you believe this happened as a result of a stack
==18388==  overflow in your program's main thread (unlikely but
==18388==  possible), you can try to increase the size of the
==18388==  main thread stack using the --main-stacksize= flag.

2. 对于单个客户端而言，发送消息过于频繁会造成线程被占用
